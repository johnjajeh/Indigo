What parts of the level to observe (technology requirements)
- The player can “pick up” objects
	- Apple for health
	- Compass for direction
- The enemy approaches the player and reduces the player’s health. When this happens, the enemy will pause for 5 seconds, and the player can move away without being harmed within that 5 seconds.
- When the player reaches the safe zone, the player wins! If the player loses all hearts (lives), the player loses.
